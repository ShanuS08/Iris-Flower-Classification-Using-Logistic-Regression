# Iris-Flower-Classification-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project involves training a logistic regression model using the Iris flower dataset to classify flowers into three categories: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. The dataset includes 150 samples with four features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, accuracy evaluation, and prediction on test samples.
# Features
